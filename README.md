# 100DaysofCloudNative

Day 1: June 7, 2021

I started learning Cloud Native skills in March 2021. It began with a LinuxFoundation course: ["Introduction to Cloud Infrastructure Technologies
"](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS151.x+2T2020/home). Then in April 2021 I applied for Udacity's SUSE Scholarship challenge and started preparing by taking additional couses that would prepare me for the program. I completed the LinuxFoundation ["Introduction to Kubernetes"](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS158x+3T2020/home) course on edx. In May 2021, I started the Microsoft Build Cloud Skills Challenge. I chose the ["Cache me if you can"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/users/cloudskillschallenge/collections/w2gkhj0dz776?WT.mc_id=cloudskillschallenge_19b18234-721a-48c8-a1c0-cba386237fab): "Build cloud-native applications that can run anywhere. Gain greater flexibility and efficiency by leveraging turnkey application services where you only have to write once." Then in June, I completed the LinkedIn Learning Path ["Master Cloud-Native Infrastructure with Kubernetes"](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/master-cloud-native-infrastructure-with-kubernetes).

Completed [Instrument a cloud-native ASP.NET Core microservice](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/microservices-logging-aspnet-core/) Microsoft Learn Module.  The module covered a review of diagnostics logging and performance monitoring concepts, implemented diagnostics logging and monitoring with Application Insights, enabled Azure Monitor for Containers in a Kubernetes cluster, create a custom performance metric using Prometheus, and examined a custom performance metric using Azure Monitor for Containers.

Completed [Introduction to infrastructure as code using Bicep](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/introduction-to-infrastructure-as-code-using-bicep)

And with that, I am officially done with the Microsoft Build Cloud Skills Challenge! 

The best news is that today begins the SUSE Cloud Native Foundations Scholarship challenge with Udacity.

<img src="images/SUSE+Scholarship+badge.png" width="400" height="400">

I logged into the classroom and stated meeting some of the new scholars in the program. Looking forward to learning a lot of new things.

Day 2: June 8, 2021

Completed [Lesson 1: Welcome](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd064-1/dashboard/overview) of the SUSE Cloud Native progam with Udacity. Today, I went over a first pass of the material for lesson 2: "Architecture Consideration for Cloud Native Applications". 

This lesson covered covered development practices that should be considered to optimize an application's resilience, time to recovery, and traceability. Also covered how to build an application using monolith and microservice-based architecture. The choice of an application structure is highly impacted by available resources, requirements, and involved trade-offs. 

Day 3: June 9, 2021

Today we will have the orientation to the program. I look forward to meeting more scholars from around the world. 

I attended a several sessions of a [Java for Kubernetes](https://www.j4k.io/) online event featuring migrating and optimizing multi-cloud applications to run on Kubernetes.

Day 57 August 7, 2021

Continuing with the TODOS from the list above. Today, I completed #1 -Microsoft's [Introduction to Kubernetes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-kubernetes/) module. Covered how Kubernetes supports container orchestration, the difference between control planes and nodes, and evaluate whether Kubernates is an appropriate orchestration platform for a given workload. 

Exercise within module: [Explore the functionality of a Kubernetes cluster](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/intro-to-kubernetes/5-exercise-kubernetes-functionality?pivots=windows). In this exercise: Single-node cluster. Configured a MicroK8s environment on Windows, deployed an NGIX website and scaled it out to multiple instances, and finally delete the running pods and cleaned up the cluster. Note: MicroK8s are similar to MiniKube. Explored the differences between the various options: [K3d vs k3s vs KInd vs MicroK8s vs Minikube](https://thechief.io/c/editorial/k3d-vs-k3s-vs-kind-vs-microk8s-vs-minikube/) and [CNCF-Webinar Navigating the Sea of Local Clusters](https://www.cncf.io/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/CNCF-Webinar-Navigating-the-Sea-of-Local-Clusters-.pdf).

7. Uninstalled MicroK8s. 
8. Removed Multipass VM manager from my computer: exited the VM, Stopped the VM, deleted and purged the VM instance.

Day 58 - August 8, 2021

Continuing with the TODOS from the list above. Today, I completed #4 -Microsoft Learn module: [Deploy a containerized application on Azure Kubernetes Service](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/aks-deploy-container-app/)

Completed the module and read through the additional resources and articles. This mudule was timed for 1 hour. It took me about 3 hours to cover all of this material. The sandbox was not working, so I used my Azure Portal Subscription to go through the exercises.

In this module: I created and set up an AKS cluster, deployed Kubernetes workloads by using deployment YAML files, and exposed Kubernetes workloads by using services and incress. 

Notes: 
* In the most common case of Kubernets cluster architecture you have one control plane and several nodes to support the workloads. One can have several nodes with different sizes in different node pools across the cluster. One can tell applications and pods to spin up in nodes according to their characteristics. 
* The HTTP application routing add-on allows for instant exposing of an app to external networks when you create ingresses. It allows you to instantly expose workloads to the web.
* Container registeries are remote storage for container images outside the local machine safely so Kubernetes can download and run them.
* Manifests describe what kind of workloads you want to create and manage. 

* ClusterIP service type expose the selected pods internally (group pods into one single IP that's only available within the cluster.  
  
* LoadBalancer service type expose the selected pods externally by using an Azure Load Balancer solution. 
* Ingress defines a set of rules to allow external application into the cluster. 

Additional Resources: 
* [Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) Production Baseline](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/reference-architectures/containers/aks/secure-baseline-aks)

* [Kubernetes service types](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/service/#publishing-services-service-types)
   
Day 59 - August 9, 2021

Continuing with the TODOS from the list above. Today, I started with module: #5 'Optimize compute costs on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)'.

Day 60 - August 10, 2021

Finished module: [Optimize compute costs on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/aks-optimize-compute-costs/)

Notes: 
* Explored strategies to optimize AKS compute costs. Ways to manage the cost-effective deployment of many workloads to meet customer demands. 

* An AKS cluster with three user noe pools give you flexibility to scale the node count in each pool indemendently for each component in the solution. Because you didn't enable the autoscaler on the GPU-based node pool, that pool's node count can be scaled to zero to optimize compute costs.

* The Kubernetes cluster autoscaler scales the number of nodes up or down based on computing resources required, it scales the number of nodes by monitoring the Metrics API. 

* If we have a statless service that processes online orders and runs on an AKS cluster, use spot node pools on the AKS cluster to optimize costs. To do so, we run the `az nodepool add` command to add a new spot user node pool. They can't be updated, and availability can't be guaranteed, because Azure will allocate VMs to the underlying scale set only if capacity is available.

* The Delete eviction policy enables you to avoid both paying disk costs and hitting quota limits. This option is the most cost effective on to use with spot node pools.

* To ensure that workloads are scheduled on the nodes of the psot user node pool you configure the workload manifest file with a toleration that uses the key `kubernetes.azure.com.scalesetpriority` and applies the `NoSchedule` effect. This configuration tells the system to schedule the workload on the nodes in the spot node pool.

Also: Listened to an online Webinar by [Tigera: "A Holistic Approach to Securing and Troubleshooting Cloud Native Applications: A Fireside Chat"](https://www.tigera.io/event/a-holistic-approach-to-securing-and-troubleshooting-cloud-native-applications-a-fireside-chat/).

Day 61 - August 11, 2021

Continuing with the TODOS from the list above. Today, I completed module:#6  [Application and package management using Helm](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/aks-app-package-management-using-helm/)

Covered:
1. Benefits of using HELM as a Kubernetes package manager.
2. Created a HELM chart for a cloud-native application
3. Managed a cloud-native release using helm
4. [What is Helm](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/aks-app-package-management-using-helm/2-what-is-helm): the Helm client, Helm Chart, Helm release, Helm repository, and benefits of using Helm.

Notes:  

* When you deploy a Helm chart, the applications deployed in the chart are deployed as a release. By splitting the deployment across two charts, this strategy allows you to manage each component in a separate development life cycle for upgrades and fixes.

* When deploying a Helm chart, the applications deployed in the chart are deployed as a release. A single release can make it easier to manage upgrades and fixes to the components that have dependencies.

* The manual management of many YAML files introduces unnecessary risk when teams want to target efficient deployment, operation, and maintenance of Kubernetes application releases. 
* By using Helm, DevOps teams can use Helm to standardize, simplify, and implement reusable deployment packages.
* Covered how to install third-party packages into your Azure Kubernetes (AKS) Cluster and how to create Helm charts for the applications your teams develop. 

* Covered how introducing Helm, as part of your software development and release strategy, introduces many benefits to simply application deployments and improve productivity.


Day 62 - August 12, 2021

Today, I finished the last item on the TODOS from Lesson 3 - #7 from the list above: [Azure Kubernetes Service Workshop](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/aks-workshop/)

I spent almost 4 hours on this workshop, a lot of it was review, but I also learened several new things.

Things learned: 
* Create an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster
* Choose the best deployment options for your Pods
* Expose Pods to internal and external network users
* Configure SSL/TLS for Azure Kubernetes Service ingress
* Monitor the health of an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster
* Scale your application in an Azure Kubernetes Service cluster

Summary: In this workshop, I learned to deploy container-based applications in my environment to AKS. In this workshop, I deployed a multicontainer application to Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS), used Azure Container Registry (ACR) to store your container images, deployed MongoDB with Helm and learned about key Kubernetes concepts to make deployments easier, and support communication between applications and services. Set up TSL/SSL to ensure communication is encrypted, and also set up autoscaling to handle fluctuations in traffic.

I am honored to have been selected to continue learning cloud native skills with Udacity in the [SUSE Cloud Native Scholarship program](https://www.udacity.com/scholarships/suse-cloud-native-foundations-scholarship). I am among top 300 out of over 12,000 scholars to have been selected to advance to the Cloud Native Application Architecture Nanodegree program.

Day 63 - August 13, 2021

Today I looked over the syllabus for the [Cloud Native Application Architecture Nanodegree Program](https://github.com/Cloud-repos/100DaysofCloudNative/blob/main/Cloud%2BNative%2BApplication%2BArchitecture%2BNanodegree%2BProgram%2BSyllabus.pdf). I am looking forward to all the things to be learned over the next sixteen weeks! The program will run from August 16 to December 6, 2021.

August 14-15 Took two days off to catch up on my Azure Nanodegree programs.

Day 64 August 16, 2021

Phase 2 of the Udacity Cloud Native Application Architecture Program Nanodegree Program started today. Today I completed the following: Set up Study Schedule for the next two weeks. I completed the new items in lesson 1, meeting the new instructors and the plan for success. I also went over the completed material as a brief review. I also looked over the project deadlines, forums, and a brief overview at the entire program. 

Day 65 August 17, 2021
I looked over the 1st project for the Cloud Native Applications Architecture Nanodegree program. I stared with step 1, Best Practices for Application Deployment - Healthcheck and Metrics endpoints. Read over some of the [Kubernetes documentation for configuring liveness, readiness, and Startup Probes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-startup-probes/).

Day 66 August 18, 2021

Continued working on Step 1. Today I read over documentation for adding logs to the application:
* [Best string formatting technique for logging in Python](https://dev.to/izabelakowal/what-is-the-best-string-formatting-technique-for-logging-in-python-d1d)
* [Python Logging Best Practices](https://coralogix.com/blog/python-logging-best-practices-tips/)
* [Python Logging documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/howto/logging.html)

August 19-20, 2021 Took some time off for several family activities.

Day 67 August 21, 2021 Today I continued working on the TechTrends project for my Udacity Cloud Native Nanodegree program. Today, I continued working on step 1: implementing the logging, and started working on step 2: Docker for Application Packaging. This step forcuses on packaging the application using Docker. It requires writing a Dockerfile and building a Docker image and running and testing the application locally inside a Docker container.
