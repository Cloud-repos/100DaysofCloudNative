# 100DaysofCloudNative

Day 1: June 7, 2021

I started learning Cloud Native skills in March 2021. It began with a LinuxFoundation course: ["Introduction to Cloud Infrastructure Technologies
"](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS151.x+2T2020/home). Then in April 2021 I applied for Udacity's SUSE Scholarship challenge and started preparing by taking additional couses that would prepare me for the program. I completed the LinuxFoundation ["Introduction to Kubernetes"](https://learning.edx.org/course/course-v1:LinuxFoundationX+LFS158x+3T2020/home) course on edx. In May 2021, I started the Microsoft Build Cloud Skills Challenge. I chose the ["Cache me if you can"](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/users/cloudskillschallenge/collections/w2gkhj0dz776?WT.mc_id=cloudskillschallenge_19b18234-721a-48c8-a1c0-cba386237fab): "Build cloud-native applications that can run anywhere. Gain greater flexibility and efficiency by leveraging turnkey application services where you only have to write once." Then in June, I completed the LinkedIn Learning Path ["Master Cloud-Native Infrastructure with Kubernetes"](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/paths/master-cloud-native-infrastructure-with-kubernetes).
